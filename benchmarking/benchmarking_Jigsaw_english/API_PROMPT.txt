Definition of toxic content:

Content is considered **toxic** when it contains hurtful, inappropriate, contemptuous, violent, or morally reprehensible statements. This notably includes:

– insults or humiliating remarks aimed at a person or a group;
– derogatory stereotypes or generalizations, even if formulated in an ironic or ambiguous tone;
– inappropriate or degrading sexualized remarks;
– incitements to hatred, violence, or exclusion, threats;
– messages expressing contempt, dehumanization, or a manifest intention to harm, shock, or belittle;
– very problematic stances.

Content can be toxic even without explicit insults or vulgarity, if it implies a hostile judgment, a malicious intention, or a climate of harassment.

Conversely, a message can be non-toxic even if it contains vulgar language, criticism, insults, or light mockery — toxicity depends on the author's intention and the intensity of the statement.
